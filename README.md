Title: Easy or hard; A Game of Imaginations (and Gambling)

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to explore the field of game development in a limited view, through various aspects like map creation and sprite implementations. 

Goal: I hoped to have created a fully functioning game with attack features for the player with a small gatcha-like system. 

Technology used:    
                    1. Pygame; cross-platform set of Python modules which allows for the writing of games.
                    2. Tiled; A 2D level editor which helps to develop certain features of the game. 
                    3.
